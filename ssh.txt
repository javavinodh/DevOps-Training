1. Keypair(private and public keys exchange)
2. password mechanism

> openssh is alrady installed thats why ssh is working .
$ ssh-keygen
$ it creates 2 keys one public and one private key
$ cat  .ssh/id_rsa.pub

  This is public key , I will share it by mail. 


on machine 2 you need to create one directory.

$ mkdir .ssh

// if it is there no need to create .ssh

$ cd .ssh

.ssh $ authorised_keys

from machine 1:

$ ssh ec2-user@ip of machine2 
machine2 $  

// now you can work on machine2 from machine1

m2$ ls
m2$ mkdir dir1
dir1$ touch file1
$ echo welcome to sorties > file1 
$ cat file1
// after your work is done you can close the connection to machine 2

$ exit 

// now youcan go and see in machine2 wheter your work is updated or not.

// without login also we can pass the commands to machine2 from machine1

m1$ ssh ec2-user@ip <commands to be executed on machine2>

m1$ ssh ec2-user@ip ls
m1$ ssh ec2-user@ip df -h
m1$ ssh ec2-user@ip free -mh
m1$ ssh ec2-user@ip touch file10

------

// Password mechanism

m2$ sudo useradd vinodh
m2$ sudo -i
# passwd vinodh

m1$ ssh vinodh@ip touch file9

// if you don't give username it will work on the current user 

m1$ ssh ip touch f10
m1$ id 

m1  $ ssh vinodh //
